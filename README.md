Introduction
This repository contains a Python script for performing logistic regression on STR (Short Tandem Repeat) data. The model is designed to predict outcomes based on the provided dataset, using logistic regression, a fundamental statistical method for binary classification tasks.
Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The script reads the dataset, handles missing values, and prepares the data for modeling.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Implements a logistic regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations for understanding the model performance, such as ROC curves and confusion matrices.
Installation
To run the script, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/STR-logistic-regression.git
cd STR-logistic-regression

2. **Run the script**:
python STR_logetic_regression.py

3. **Input Data**: Ensure your data is in the correct format as expected by the script. You may need to modify the data loading section to match your specific data format.
Data
The script expects data in a CSV format with specific columns that correspond to the features used in the logistic regression model. Ensure that the data is clean and preprocessed as required.
